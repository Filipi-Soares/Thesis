Follow the instrction:
Task: build an ontology for the taxonomic classification for the species Apis mellifera.
Step 0: access the GBIF API: https://api.gbif.org/v1/
Step 1: extract the full taxonomic classification for the target species. For each species, also extract the higher taxon levels (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus). In some cases, the name in the list is the species name, and in other cases, the genus name. 
Step 2: This taxonomy should be organized as owl classes and subclasses (do not create individuals, instances). Each class should have a valid URI from GBIF, and a rdf label of the name for that class, with the language tag (considering that scientific names are all latin, include the language tag "lat").
Step 3: if a name has the status “deprecated”, look for the valid name for that species.
Step 4: output: generate a single OWL code, including all the necessary namespaces.

The attempts to match the species names "Prochilodus Cearensis," "Prochilodus Scrofa," and "Prochilodus Margravii" with the GBIF database did not yield any results due to too little confidence in the matches. This means that the specific names provided might not be directly available in the GBIF database under those exact spellings or they are not recognized at the species level in the database.

For taxonomic research and ontology building, accurate species names are crucial. It's possible that these names might have synonyms under which they are listed in databases, or there might be slight variations in spelling or taxonomy that affect the search results.

In such cases, further steps could include:

Verifying the scientific names for spelling or taxonomic updates.
Searching for broader taxonomic groups (e.g., the genus "Prochilodus") and then narrowing down to the species level based on additional sources or databases.
Consulting specialized taxonomic databases or literature for the most current classification and synonyms.
If you have alternative or broader taxonomic categories in mind or need assistance with another query, please let me know how I can assist further.
